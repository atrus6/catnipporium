# About Us
This all started out as a way to turn spare fabric into some cat toys for the my own cats. I was selling 2 pillows for less than the cost of postage, not a great way to run a business.

After figuring out better pricing, I started to explore more fun and creative patterns, settling on a mix of premade and my own designs for fabric. They were a hit, and Catnipporium pillows have made it to every continent, except Antartica, where there aren't any cats.

Catnipporium expanded into furniture, which are currently undergoing a revamp to make them even *more* durable and long lasting. It'll be back soon!

Here's to many more years of cute cat stuff!
